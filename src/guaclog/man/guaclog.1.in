.SH NAME
guaclog \- Guacamole input log interpreter
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B guaclog
[\fB-f\fR]
[\fIFILE\fR]...
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B guaclog
is an interpreter which accepts Guacamole protocol dumps, such as those saved
when input logging is enabled on a Guacamole connection, writing human-readable
text logs as output.
.B guaclog
is essentially an implementation of a Guacamole client which accepts
its input from files instead of a network connection, however unlike
.B guacenc
it only handles instructions related to user input.
.P
Each \fIFILE\fR specified will be translated into a new human-readable text
file named \fIFILE\fR.txt. Existing files will not be overwritten; the
interpreting process for any input file will be aborted if it would result in
overwriting an existing file.
.P
Guacamole acquires a write lock on input logs as they are being written. By
default,
.B guaclog
will check whether the each input file is locked and will refuse to read and
interpret an input file if it appears to be an in-progress log. This behavior
can be overridden by specifying the \fB-f\fR option. Interpreting an
in-progress log will still work; the resulting human-readable text file will
simply cover the user's session only up to the current point in time.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-f\fR
Overrides the default behavior of
.B guaclog
such that input files will be interpreted even if they appear to be logs of
in-progress Guacamole sessions.
